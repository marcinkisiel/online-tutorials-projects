### description

In this repo I'm coding interesting frontend ideas from the YouTube channel called **_[Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog)_** by Indian developer **Muhammad Irshad**. <br/>
Obviously this code is not mine, but I treat this repo as a base of snippets for my own projects, especially since I try to code them as independent components according to the **BEM** convention. <br/>
Most of the examples were prepared for desktop view and their practical use requires adjustments for mobile devices.
